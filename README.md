This is a Mapbox-hosted map of the City of San Jos√© with a color-coded overlay of sidewalk widths. It was inspired by [Sidewalk Widths NYC](https://www.sidewalkwidths.nyc/) and uses the same color scheme. The sidewalk data was acquired from the Department of Public Works' [GIS Spatial Data Download](https://www.sanjoseca.gov/your-government/departments-offices/public-works/resources/gis-data-downloads) and processed with PostgreSQL.
